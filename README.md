# NYC Housing Complaints analysis & prediction

This repository contains the source code, data pipeline scripts, and documentation for our group project: **NYC Housing Complaints analysis & Prediction using Big Data & Machine Learning**.

## 📌 Project Overview

With rapid urbanization in New York City, housing-related complaints (e.g., heating, plumbing, safety) are on the rise. This project leverages Big Data tools and Machine Learning models to analyze 311 housing complaints and other datasets to:

- Predict complaint trends
- Score neighborhoods/buildings on livability
- Aid decision-makers (tenants, housing officials, real estate agencies)

## 👨‍💻 Team Members (Group 4)

- Team Leader: Chetan Swaroop Sapedi  
- Members: Prateek Kulshrestha,Vedika Mule, Rushikesh Pabalkar, Sonu Lad, Abhishek Singh, Anannya Sarkar, Shakyadita Sonawane

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Unstructured and large-scale housing data makes it difficult to evaluate complaint-prone zones and livability conditions. We aim to:
- Predict future housing complaints using ML
- Generate an Affordable Living Index
- Provide interactive dashboards for all stakeholders

## 📊 Project Flow

1. 📥 Ingest Data from NYC Open Data into S3  
2. 🔁 Transform data using AWS emr & hadoop  
3. ⚙️ Process Large Data with Spark on EMR  
4. 🧠 Train ML Models to predict complaints   
6. 📊 Visualize in Power BI dashboards  
7. 🔄 Automate using AWS Lambda triggers

## ✅ Objectives

- Forecast complaints by location/type
- Score buildings using Affordable Living Index
- Empower tenants, officials, and urban planners

## 📌 Use Cases

- Tenants: Identify safe and well-maintained areas  
- Authorities: Prioritize inspection zones  
- Real Estate: Evaluate building livability for planning  
- Public: Check neighborhood scores via dashboards

## 🚀 Expected Deliverables

- ML model for complaint prediction
- Cloud data warehouse
- Visual dashboards
- End-to-end automated ETL pipeline

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integrate crime/noise/health data
- Mobile/web dashboards for the public
- Real-time alerts to tenants and inspectors
- REST API deployment with AWS SageMaker
